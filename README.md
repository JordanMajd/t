# T

A text editor for me, written in C. 

![Screenshot of T editor's welcome message](/t.png)

It was built with the help of Snaptoken's booklet [Build Your Own Text Editor][snaptoken] which is based on [antirez's kilo][antirez].

Long term I have plans to extend it with Lua scripting but we will take it one step at a time.

# Roadmap

1. (Done) Project setup
1. (Done) Raw mode
1. (90%) Input & output
1. Text viewer
1. Text editor
1. Search
1. Syntax highlighting

After which I would like to consider adding support for Lua scripting.
